Tools used: Python3

Cleaning
1) Removed spaces from column names
2) Columns are transformed into numeric

Feature Engineering
1) Converting isIntersectingWithRoadGeometry to OneHotEncoded form
2) Reserving the weightage of roadCategory as (1 being the broadest, for e.g. highways)
3) Removed features after checking importance by h2o gbm: 'noOfIntersectingLaneLinesLeft','noOfIntersectingLaneLinesRight','fl_rd_cat'
4) Added maximum, minimum distances between lattitudes, longitudes, number of lane lines

Outlier
1) From plots removed outliers, not much affect on accuracy

Label Transformation
1) Subtracting 1 from training data with label noOfLanes to make it ready for xgboost input

Modeling
1) XG-Boost
2) h2o-gbm
3) ENsembing best results 

Prediction
1) From the various predictions of noOfLanes done by the model for each roadId, the most occuring is selected
